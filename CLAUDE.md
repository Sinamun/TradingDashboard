# TradingDashboard — CLAUDE.md

## How This Project Works

This project is managed by **TradeBot** (an OpenClaw orchestrator agent) and built by **you** (Claude Code).

**You are the coding executor.** TradeBot is the orchestrator, planner, product manager, and reviewer. You will receive task cards with clear objectives and acceptance criteria. Your job is to implement them correctly and completely.

### What you do:
- Receive task cards from TradeBot
- Implement features, fixes, and refactors in this repo
- Stay focused on the codebase and technical execution
- Report back what you built, what changed, and any blockers
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- **Keep CLAUDE.md up to date** — see rule below

### What you don't do:
- Make product decisions — ask if scope is unclear
- Skip acceptance criteria — every task card defines "done"
- Assume your work is complete without checking the criteria
- Refactor unrelated code unless asked to

---

## CLAUDE.md Maintenance Rule

**You MUST update this file as part of completing any task that changes the following:**

| Category | Examples that require an update |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Database schema | New table, new column, dropped column, renamed field, changed type or constraint |
| API routes | New route, changed request/response shape, removed route, auth changes |
| External integrations | New API or service added, switched provider, changed auth method |
| Core libraries / `lib/` | New file, changed function signatures, new utility |
| Pages / features | New page, new UI feature, removed feature |
| Architecture | New component pattern, new data flow, rendering strategy change |
| Environment variables | New var required, var renamed, var removed |
| Infrastructure | Cron schedule change, new Vercel config, deployment change |
| Tech stack | Package added/removed, version upgrade with behaviour change |
| Decisions | Any significant "why did we do it this way" choice |

**When to update:** Before committing — CLAUDE.md should be accurate at the time of every commit that touches the above.

**What to update:**
- **Project Structure** — add/remove/rename files
- **Database Schema** — reflect the actual current schema exactly
- **Implemented Features** — mark features done, add new ones
- **Status Checklist** — tick off completed items
- **Decisions Log** — add a row with the date, decision, and context
- **Environment Variables** — add any new required vars
- Any other section that is now inaccurate

**Do not wait to be asked.** Keeping CLAUDE.md current is part of the definition of done for every task.

## Database Schema

### Better Auth tables (managed by Better Auth, do not modify)
`user`, `session`, `account`, `verification` — created by `scripts/migrate-auth.ts`

### `positions` table — open and closed trading positions (per user)
```sql
id              UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
user_id         TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES "user"(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
ticker          TEXT NOT NULL                 -- Display ticker / underlying for options (e.g. AAPL)
display_name    TEXT                          -- Company name
yahoo_ticker    TEXT                          -- Yahoo Finance ticker (may differ)
asset_type      TEXT NOT NULL                 -- stock | call | put
entry_price     NUMERIC(18,6) NOT NULL
quantity        NUMERIC(18,6) NOT NULL

closed_at       TIMESTAMPTZ
close_price     NUMERIC(18,6)
created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()

RLS: ENABLED — policy "positions_user_isolation" enforces user_id = app.current_user_id
Note: neondb_owner is a superuser and bypasses RLS; explicit WHERE user_id = $userId used in all app queries
```

### `news_articles` table — AI-analysed news per ticker (global, not per user)
```sql
id              UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()

UNIQUE(ticker, date)
```

### `token_usage_log` table — daily OpenAI API cost tracking (global)
```sql

## Implemented Features

### Portfolio Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Fetches all open positions from DB (with source + notes fields)
- Fetches live prices from Yahoo Finance (current + daily change + weekly change)
- Fetches EUR/USD and GBP/USD exchange rates
- Calculates: Total P&L, Daily P&L, Weekly P&L (absolute + %)
- Summary cards: Portfolio Value, Total P&L, Daily P&L, Weekly P&L (all in GBP)
- Filterable by asset type (All / Stocks / Options) and platform (All / FreeTrade / Trading212 / IBKR / Crypto)
- Sortable columns: Ticker, Market Value, Total P&L %, Daily P&L %, Weekly P&L %
- Colour-coded P&L (green/red)
- Multi-currency display: USD, EUR, GBP, GBX (pence) — all converted to GBP for totals
- Options displayed as: `UNDERLYING STRIKE CALL/PUT EXP`
- Shows last-updated timestamp
- Empty state with "Add Position" CTA when user has zero positions
- UserAvatar in header (initials circle, dropdown with Settings + Sign Out)

### Position Management
- "Add Position" button (always visible, top-right of filter row)
- Add Position modal: Ticker, Display Name, Asset Type (Stock/Call/Put toggle), Entry Price, Quantity, Currency (USD/GBP/EUR/GBX), Platform, Strike (options only), Expiry (options only), Source, Notes
- Edit row action (pencil icon): opens modal pre-filled with current values
- Delete row action (trash icon): confirm dialog → hard delete
- All mutations call `PATCH/POST/DELETE /api/positions/[id]` then `router.refresh()` for fresh server data

### Settings Page (`/settings`)
- Edit display name (via `authClient.updateUser()`)
- Read-only email display
- Change password form (via `authClient.changePassword()`)
- Danger zone: delete account (type "delete" to confirm → `DELETE /api/user/account` → CASCADE deletes all user data)

### News Page (`/news`)
- Fetches news articles from the last 7 days
- Fetches AI ticker summaries from the last 6 days
- Fetches token usage logs for cost visibility
- Date tabs (last 7 days) with client-side filtering
- Ticker filter pills — click to filter by ticker
- Sentiment filter pills (All / Bullish / Bearish / Neutral)
- Grouped cards per ticker with sentiment breakdown counts
- AI ticker summary panel: overall_summary, recommendation badge, risks, catalysts
- Expandable article lists (3 shown by default, expand to see all)
- Each article: title, source, relative time, AI summary, tags, sentiment pill
- Token usage footer: daily input/output tokens + API call count
- Empty state messages for no articles / no filtered results

### News Cron Job (`/api/cron/news`)
- Runs daily at 14:00 UTC via Vercel cron (configured in `vercel.json`)
- Optional Bearer token auth via `CRON_SECRET` env var
- Flow:
  1. Fetch all open positions; deduplicate tickers (options → underlying ticker)
  2. Scrape up to 5 articles per ticker via Brave News Search API (freshness: past day)
  3. Filter out already-stored URLs
  4. Insert new articles (sentiment fields NULL initially)
  5. Run GPT-4o sentiment analysis per article (200ms delay between calls)
  6. Update articles with: sentiment, confidence, summary, impact, relevance, tags
  7. Generate overall ticker summary (recommendation + risks + catalysts)
  8. Backfill any existing articles still missing sentiment analysis
  9. Log token usage to `token_usage_log`
- Returns JSON: `{ tickersProcessed, articlesFound, articlesNew, articlesAnalysed, articlesBackfilled, tokens }`

## Environment Variables

## Infrastructure

| Service | Account / Detail |
|---------|-----------------|
| GitHub | Pello-Co |
| Vercel | sina-2972 |
| Neon | Serverless Postgres — connection active |
| Brave Search | API key in env |
| OpenAI | GPT-4o — key in env |

## Broader System Context

- **TradeBot** (OpenClaw agent) handles daily research, price checks, trade analysis, and Telegram notifications for Sina.
- The dashboard is the **visual layer** — TradeBot is the **intelligence layer**.
- TradeBot will read from and write to the same Neon database to keep portfolio state in sync.
- Reminders set in the dashboard should be surfaceable by TradeBot via Telegram.
- The dashboard and TradeBot share the same data model — keep schema decisions compatible.

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript** — strict mode, no `any` unless truly unavoidable
- **Tailwind CSS** — no custom CSS files unless there's a good reason
- **Next.js App Router** — server components by default, client components only for interactivity/hooks
- **Database queries** — parameterised queries only, never string concatenation
- **Error handling** — surface errors clearly in the UI, log them server-side
- **Commits** — small, frequent, with clear messages describing what changed and why
- **No premature abstraction** — keep it simple until complexity demands otherwise
- **Mobile-friendly** — Sina may check this on his phone

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Context |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2026-03-10 | Repo created as Pello-Co/TradingDashboard | — |
| 2026-03-10 | Trade sources = friends (track by name) | Sina's trade ideas come from friends |
| 2026-03-10 | Reminders via Telegram | Sina's preferred channel |
| 2026-03-10 | Stack: Next.js + Neon + Vercel | Fast to ship, serverless, low maintenance |
| 2026-03-11 | Positions table replaces trades table | Richer schema: platforms, asset types, currency, options fields |
| 2026-03-11 | Multi-currency support (USD/EUR/GBP/GBX) | Sina trades across UK and US markets |
| 2026-03-11 | Options support added | Calls and puts with strike, expiry, underlying ticker |
| 2026-03-11 | News scraper: Google News RSS → Yahoo Finance → Brave Search | Brave gives better coverage and freshness filtering |
| 2026-03-11 | AI sentiment: switched to OpenAI GPT-4o | Better quality than previous GLM model |
| 2026-03-11 | 5 articles per ticker per day | Balance between coverage and API cost |
| 2026-03-11 | Token usage logging added | Track OpenAI costs per day |
| 2026-03-11 | Date tabs for news (client-side filtering) | Better UX — no extra DB queries per tab |
| 2026-03-11 | Auth: switched from Stack Auth → Better Auth | Better Auth is fully self-hosted; no external auth SaaS needed; tables live in our own Neon DB |
| 2026-03-11 | Better Auth uses pg + Kysely (not @neondatabase/serverless) | Kysely is bundled with better-auth; pg used for auth routes only; app queries still use @neondatabase/serverless |
| 2026-03-11 | Dashboard moved from / to /dashboard | Required by Better Auth middleware redirect target; root / now redirects to /dashboard |
| 2026-03-11 | emailVerification is a top-level betterAuth option, not a plugin | Task card example was wrong; actual API uses `emailVerification: { sendVerificationEmail: ... }` |
| 2026-03-11 | Resend sender: noreply@bullist.co | Domain is bullist.co; must be verified in Resend dashboard |
| 2026-03-11 | Resend env var named RESEND_BULLIST_KEY (not RESEND_API_KEY) | Operator set it with this name in Vercel; code updated to match |
| 2026-03-11 | Phase 3 schema: UUID PKs, user_id FK, asset_type merges call/put | Simpler schema; ticker IS the underlying for options; no direction/thesis/underlying_ticker |
| 2026-03-11 | ticker_summaries recommendation: buy/hold/sell (lowercase) | Simplified from 5-value scale; matches AI prompt and DB constraint |
| 2026-03-11 | neondb_owner bypasses RLS; explicit WHERE user_id added | Superuser connections bypass Postgres RLS by default; double-filter for safety |
| 2026-03-11 | Dashboard uses sql.transaction() to set app.current_user_id before query | Correct RLS setup for future non-superuser roles; also filters by user_id explicitly |
| 2026-03-11 | Position CRUD uses server-side API routes (not server actions) | Consistent with existing REST pattern; simpler auth handling via getSession() |
| 2026-03-11 | router.refresh() used after mutations (not optimistic UI) | Simpler and reliable; re-runs server component to get fresh data from DB |
| 2026-03-11 | Account deletion via direct DB DELETE on "user" table | Better Auth deleteUser requires accountDeletion plugin; direct delete + CASCADE is simpler for single-user app |
| 2026-03-11 | Settings page is fully client-side using useSession() | Avoids server/client split for a simple form page; auth state available via Better Auth React client |

## When You're Stuck

- If the task card is ambiguous, say so and ask for clarification rather than guessing
- If you hit a real blocker (auth issue, missing env var, API limit), report it clearly
- If you think the approach in the task card is wrong, explain why and propose an alternative — but don't silently deviate
